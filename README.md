# RM
RM (short for "Room"), is a project I started working on mid-2016, after my Sophmore year in college. I stopped working on this project late 2017.

All of the source code is under the [RM](https://github.com/LF-luis/RM/tree/master/RM) directory.

The application was built alongside a Microsoft Azure backend application which will not be open-sourced.

## Build
- Xcode 8.3.3
- Swift 3
- Cocoapods and dependencies copies are included in repo

## Purpose of RM
RM started initially as an app to help college students find places where they could study or quietly relax in a large campus.  
After a while, the idea expanded to be able to find any kind of event going on around you at the moment. This is where the app currently stands.

## Purpose of this repo
I've written a lot of code in my free in the past few years, instead of letting it sit on my computer I have chosen to release it freely.  

I also hope that someone may be able to find this useful and contribute or fork this repo for their own project. Notably you'll find use of MicrosoftAzureMobile.framework to manage User log in/out session, as well as to call various secured web APIs. Also actionable Google Maps embedded in sub-views.
